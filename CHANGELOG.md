# Changelog

## [0.19.5] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Drift comparison now ignores `confidence: "low"` radius and shadow tokens — single-use, margin-of-detection elements the extractor is unsure about that surfaced inconsistently between extractions and produced phantom drift

### Added
- The CLI run summary now reflects the active flags and explicit paths of the run (DEM-99)

## [0.19.4] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Self-hosted font lists (`selfHostedFonts`, `customFonts`) are now deduped and sorted, so two extractions of the same page no longer differ by font order — eliminating phantom design drift

### Added
- `--approve` accepts the current extraction as the new baseline: with `--compare <file>`, it overwrites that local baseline and passes instead of failing. App baseline ids are read-only
- `--compare` combined with `--json-only` now attaches the full drift report (score, status, summary, per-token changes) under a `drift` key, so CI gates can render what changed from structured data instead of scraping the HTML report

## [0.17.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- Colour-valued `:root` custom properties are now captured regardless of their name, so brand tokens not named with `color`/`bg`/`text`/`brand` are no longer silently dropped
- Framework default-theme palettes exposed as `--colors-<hue>-<shade>` custom properties no longer flood the extracted CSS variables
- Status/utility-only colours (error/danger, framework warm utilities) no longer leak into the brand palette unless declared as a token or used as a recurring CTA background
- `:root` custom-property colours are treated as brand tokens: never dropped as structural, always considered for the palette, and preferred when selecting the primary colour as a bonus over usage rather than an override

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Link and text colors (e.g. `#0070e0`) were incorrectly filtered out when they never appeared as background colors — chromatic text-only colors with sufficient semantic context are now retained
- Header and single-instance brand background colors were dropped on large sites where element count pushed the frequency threshold too high — high-scoring colors now bypass the count threshold
- Modern CSS color functions (`oklab`, `oklch`, `lch`, `lab`, `color()`) were leaking into the palette as unparseable strings — these are now rejected at all extraction paths including hover/focus state merging

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Neutralized documentation terminology
- Removed third-party brand examples from test fixtures

- Lowered content validation threshold from 500 to 100 chars for minimal-text sites
- Clearer border style display with `(per-side)` label for shorthand values
- Shadows now sorted by confidence and usage frequency (most confident first)
