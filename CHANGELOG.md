# Changelog

## [0.22.0] - unreleased

### Changed
- Logo extraction reworked for recall and precision, measured against 103 human-judged sites: recall 0.64 -> 0.67, and known non-logos proposed cut from 11/21 to 4/21 (total proposals 206 -> 178). Concretely: header-zone selection no longer loses to cookie-dialog/modal `[class*=header]` elements; inline-`<svg>` logos wrapped in a home link are found (previously only `<img>` was); below-fold and footer logos that link home now qualify; symbol+wordmark lockups are kept as separate instances instead of collapsing to one; customer/partner-wall logos (detected structurally as a group of >=3 sizable marks in one content container) and 16-20px UI icons are no longer proposed; logos linking to a localized homepage (/en, /de) are recognized as the site's own
- Each logo instance now reports a `rect` (the painted on-screen box, correct for `object-fit`/`preserveAspectRatio` letterboxing, padding, border and transforms) alongside the existing intrinsic `width`/`height`; a `natural` field carries the asset's intrinsic size

### Added
- `lib/extractors/logo-heuristics.ts`: the pure, DOM-free logo decisions (home-link, position→context, third-party-brand detection, painted-box geometry, minimum logo size), serialized into the page so the browser runs the exact same code, with 30 unit tests

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Hidden-content reveal (open click-toggle menus/dropdowns, advance carousels, then re-scan) is now standard and on by default. Closed panels and off-screen slides hold brand colours that the static scan never sees, so this materially improves colour recall. Set `DEMBRANDT_DISABLE_REVEAL=1` to skip it, which QA baselines do to stay deterministic
- Colour extraction recovers card/section/input/badge colours previously lost to structural filtering, and lifts colours from ancestor context, footers, and carousel-revealed panels (DEM-68)

### Added
- `./findings` subpath export exposes the high-recall detected colour set for the ML pipeline, separate from the scored brand palette

### Removed
- `--menus` opt-in flag. The reveal pass it gated is now the default, so the flag is redundant

## [0.20.1] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- `--stealth` spoofs the WebGL renderer and audio fingerprint so extraction survives stricter bot detection (#100)

### Fixed
- Near-white primary and transparent secondary colours are guarded against, so washed-out or invisible picks no longer surface as brand colours (DEM-112, DEM-113, #103)
- Cloud upload targets `www.dembrandt.com` and is overridable via the `DEMBRANDT_API_URL` env var

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- `--key` pushes each extraction to your Dembrandt account and auto-scores it against the previous snapshot for that domain (#105)
- `--ai` predicts the brand primary colour with a trained ML model, replacing the heuristic when enabled (roughly 2x accuracy)
- Platform-specific colour hints: `theme-color`, `mask-icon`, and `msapplication` meta values now feed the palette (#101)

### Fixed
- SVG logo fill/stroke colours are extracted from the logo's own elements (DEM-111, #102)
- Core hardening and internal refinements across extraction (#99)

## [0.19.5] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Drift comparison now ignores `confidence: "low"` radius and shadow tokens — single-use, margin-of-detection elements the extractor is unsure about that surfaced inconsistently between extractions and produced phantom drift

### Added
- The CLI run summary now reflects the active flags and explicit paths of the run (DEM-99)

## [0.19.4] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed
- Self-hosted font lists (`selfHostedFonts`, `customFonts`) are now deduped and sorted, so two extractions of the same page no longer differ by font order — eliminating phantom design drift

### Added
- `--approve` accepts the current extraction as the new baseline: with `--compare <file>`, it overwrites that local baseline and passes instead of failing. App baseline ids are read-only
- `--compare` combined with `--json-only` now attaches the full drift report (score, status, summary, per-token changes) under a `drift` key, so CI gates can render what changed from structured data instead of scraping the HTML report

## [0.17.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- Colour-valued `:root` custom properties are now captured regardless of their name, so brand tokens not named with `color`/`bg`/`text`/`brand` are no longer silently dropped
- Framework default-theme palettes exposed as `--colors-<hue>-<shade>` custom properties no longer flood the extracted CSS variables
- Status/utility-only colours (error/danger, framework warm utilities) no longer leak into the brand palette unless declared as a token or used as a recurring CTA background
- `:root` custom-property colours are treated as brand tokens: never dropped as structural, always considered for the palette, and preferred when selecting the primary colour as a bonus over usage rather than an override

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Link and text colors (e.g. `#0070e0`) were incorrectly filtered out when they never appeared as background colors — chromatic text-only colors with sufficient semantic context are now retained
- Header and single-instance brand background colors were dropped on large sites where element count pushed the frequency threshold too high — high-scoring colors now bypass the count threshold
- Modern CSS color functions (`oklab`, `oklch`, `lch`, `lab`, `color()`) were leaking into the palette as unparseable strings — these are now rejected at all extraction paths including hover/focus state merging

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Neutralized documentation terminology
- Removed third-party brand examples from test fixtures
- Added `.claudeignore` for AI tool safety

### Removed
- Brand challenge test suite (replaced with QA baseline tests)
- Third-party brand screenshots and example outputs

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added
- `--slow` flag for slow-loading sites with 3x longer timeouts
- Tailwind CSS exporter (`lib/exporters.js`)
- QA test suite for visual comparison and regression detection
- GitHub Actions CI workflow for automated testing
- Border detection with confidence scoring

### Changed
- Improved terminal output with tree structure
- Enhanced retry logic for empty content
- Better SPA hydration detection
- Test suite refocused on SPA and interactive sites
- Lowered content validation threshold from 500 to 100 chars for minimal-text sites
- Clearer border style display with `(per-side)` label for shorthand values
- Shadows now sorted by confidence and usage frequency (most confident first)
- Button detection now includes outline/bordered buttons (previously skipped transparent backgrounds)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-22

### Added
- `--dark-mode` and `--mobile` flags
- Clickable terminal links
- Enhanced bot detection avoidance

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-21
